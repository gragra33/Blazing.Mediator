    public int UserId { get; init; }
}

// Alternative: CQRS naming (same functionality)
public class GetUserQuery : IQuery<UserDto>
{
    public int UserId { get; init; }
}

public class GetUserHandler : IRequestHandler<GetUserQuery, UserDto>
// Alternative: public class GetUserHandler : IQueryHandler<GetUserQuery, UserDto>
{
    public async Task<UserDto> Handle(GetUserQuery request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Your logic here
        return new UserDto { Id = request.UserId, Name = "John Doe" };
    }
}

// Command (Write operation) - Generic approach
public class CreateUserCommand : IRequest<int>
{
    public string Name { get; init; } = string.Empty;
    public string Email { get; init; } = string.Empty;
}

public class CreateUserHandler : IRequestHandler<CreateUserCommand, int>
{
    public async Task<int> Handle(CreateUserCommand request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Your logic here
        return 1; // Return new user ID
    }
}
```

### üè∑Ô∏è CQRS Naming Conventions

Blazing.Mediator provides **both generic and CQRS-specific interfaces** for maximum flexibility:

| **CQRS Interface**     | **Generic Equivalent** | **Use Case**                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `IQuery<TResponse>`    | `IRequest<TResponse>`  | Read operations that return data      |
| `ICommand`             | `IRequest`             | Write operations with no return value |
| `ICommand<TResponse>`  | `IRequest<TResponse>`  | Write operations that return data     |
| `IQueryHandler<T,R>`   | `IRequestHandler<T,R>` | Handles queries                       |
| `ICommandHandler<T>`   | `IRequestHandler<T>`   | Handles void commands                 |
| `ICommandHandler<T,R>` | `IRequestHandler<T,R>` | Handles commands with return values   |

**Both approaches work identically** - choose based on your team's preferences:

-   **Generic**: `IRequest` for flexibility and simplicity
-   **CQRS**: `IQuery`/`ICommand` for explicit business intent

### Use in Controllers

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class UsersController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IMediator _mediator;

    public UsersController(IMediator mediator) => _mediator = mediator;

    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public async Task<UserDto> GetUser(int id)
    {
        return await _mediator.Send(new GetUserQuery { UserId = id });
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<int> CreateUser(CreateUserCommand command)
    {
        return await _mediator.Send(command);
    }
}
```

## üåü Feature Highlights

### **üîß Advanced Configuration**

Blazing.Mediator provides a powerful fluent configuration API that adapts to your environment automatically. Configure your mediator with environment-aware presets, JSON configuration support, and comprehensive validation. The configuration system includes intelligent discovery options for middleware and handlers, advanced statistics tracking, and seamless OpenTelemetry integration. Whether you're running in development, staging, or production, the configuration system ensures optimal settings for your deployment environment.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddMediator(config =>
{
    config.WithStatisticsTracking()
          .WithOpenTelemetryIntegration()
          .WithMiddlewareDiscovery()
          .WithNotificationHandlerDiscovery()
          .AddAssembly(typeof(Program).Assembly);
});
```

For comprehensive configuration patterns and advanced scenarios, see the **[Configuration Guide](docs/MEDIATOR_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md)**.

### **üåä Streaming Support**

Native streaming support enables memory-efficient processing of large datasets through `IAsyncEnumerable<T>`. Perfect for real-time data feeds, large file processing, and server-sent events. The streaming infrastructure includes full middleware pipeline support, allowing you to apply cross-cutting concerns like logging, validation, and metrics to your streaming operations. This eliminates the need to load entire datasets into memory, providing superior performance for data-intensive applications.

```csharp
// Streaming request
public class GetDataStream : IStreamRequest<DataItem>
{
    public string Source { get; init; } = string.Empty;
}

// Streaming handler
public class GetDataStreamHandler : IStreamRequestHandler<GetDataStream, DataItem>
{
    public async IAsyncEnumerable<DataItem> Handle(GetDataStream request, [EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        await foreach (var item in ProcessDataAsync(request.Source, cancellationToken))
        {
            yield return item;
        }
    }
}

// Use in controller
[HttpGet("stream")]
public async IAsyncEnumerable<DataItem> StreamData([EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    await foreach (var item in _mediator.SendStream(new GetDataStream { Source = "database" }, cancellationToken))
    {
        yield return item;
    }
}
```

For detailed streaming patterns and real-world examples, see the **[Streaming Guide](docs/MEDIATOR_STREAMING_GUIDE.md)**.

### **üì¢ Event-Driven Architecture**

Build robust event-driven systems with comprehensive notification support featuring both automatic handler discovery and manual subscription patterns. The notification system supports multiple handlers per event, complete middleware pipelines, and type-constrained processing for optimal performance. Whether you need decoupled domain events, observer patterns, or pub/sub messaging, the notification infrastructure provides the flexibility to implement complex event-driven architectures with ease.

```csharp
// Domain event
public class UserCreatedNotification : INotification
{
    public int UserId { get; init; }
    public string Email { get; init; } = string.Empty;
}

// Multiple handlers for the same event
public class EmailWelcomeHandler : INotificationHandler<UserCreatedNotification>
{
    public async Task Handle(UserCreatedNotification notification, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Send welcome email
    }
}

public class AnalyticsHandler : INotificationHandler<UserCreatedNotification>
{
    public async Task Handle(UserCreatedNotification notification, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Track user registration
    }
}

// Publish event
await _mediator.Publish(new UserCreatedNotification { UserId = userId, Email = email });
```

For complete event-driven patterns and notification strategies, see the **[Notification System Guide](docs/MEDIATOR_NOTIFICATION_GUIDE.md)**.

### **üìä Built-in Observability**

Comprehensive observability is built into every aspect of Blazing.Mediator, providing deep insights into your application's behavior. Full OpenTelemetry integration delivers distributed tracing, metrics collection, and performance monitoring for cloud-native applications. The statistics system tracks execution patterns, success rates, and performance metrics across all operations. Combined with extensive debug logging infrastructure, you get complete visibility into request handling, middleware execution, and notification processing for both development debugging and production monitoring.

```csharp
// Enable OpenTelemetry integration
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
    .WithTracing(tracing => tracing.AddBlazingMediatorInstrumentation())
    .WithMetrics(metrics => metrics.AddBlazingMediatorInstrumentation());

// Access built-in statistics
public class HealthController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IStatisticsService _statistics;

    [HttpGet("stats")]
    public async Task<MetricsSummary> GetStats()
    {
        return await _statistics.GetSummaryAsync();
    }
}
```

### CQRS Implementation

Blazing.Mediator naturally implements the **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** pattern with comprehensive interface support:

#### Core Interfaces

**Generic Interfaces (Foundation)**
- `IRequest` - Commands that don't return data (void operations)
- `IRequest<TResponse>` - Queries/Commands that return data
- `IRequestHandler<TRequest>` - Handlers for void operations
- `IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>` - Handlers for operations returning data

**CQRS Semantic Interfaces**
- `ICommand` - Write operations with no return value (extends `IRequest`)
- `ICommand<TResponse>` - Write operations returning data (extends `IRequest<TResponse>`)
- `IQuery<TResponse>` - Read operations returning data (extends `IRequest<TResponse>`)
- `ICommandHandler<TRequest>` - Command handlers (extends `IRequestHandler<TRequest>`)
- `ICommandHandler<TRequest, TResponse>` - Command handlers with return values (extends `IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`)
- `IQueryHandler<TRequest, TResponse>` - Query handlers (extends `IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`)

#### Streaming Support
- `IStreamRequest<TResponse>` - Streaming requests returning `IAsyncEnumerable<TResponse>`
- `IStreamRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>` - Handlers for streaming operations
- `IStreamRequestMiddleware<TRequest, TResponse>` - Middleware for streaming pipelines

#### Notification System (Dual Pattern Support)

**Automatic Handler Pattern (Publish-Subscribe)**
- `INotification` - Marker interface for domain events
- `INotificationHandler<TNotification>` - Automatic handlers discovered via DI
- `INotificationMiddleware` - Middleware for notification pipelines

**Manual Subscriber Pattern (Observer)**
- `INotificationSubscriber<TNotification>` - Manual subscribers requiring explicit registration
- Runtime subscription control via `mediator.Subscribe()` and `mediator.Unsubscribe()`

#### Type-Constrained Middleware Support
- **Request Middleware**: Can be constrained to `ICommand`, `IQuery<T>`, or other interfaces
- **Notification Middleware**: Can be constrained to specific notification categories
- **Performance Benefits**: Only executes middleware relevant to the request type

#### Handler Registration Flexibility
Both approaches work identically - choose based on your team's preferences:
- **Generic**: `IRequest`/`IRequestHandler` for flexibility and simplicity
- **CQRS**: `IQuery`/`ICommand`/`IQueryHandler`/`ICommandHandler` for explicit business intent
