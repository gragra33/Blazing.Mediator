## Quick Start

### Installation

Add the [Blazing.Mediator](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Blazing.Mediator) NuGet package to your project.

Install the package via .NET CLI or the NuGet Package Manager.

#### .NET CLI

```bash
dotnet add package Blazing.Mediator
```

#### NuGet Package Manager

```powershell
Install-Package Blazing.Mediator
```

#### Manually adding to your project

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Blazing.Mediator" Version="1.7.0" />
```

### Configuration

Configure the library in your `Program.cs` file. The `AddMediator` method will add the required services and automatically register request handlers from the specified assemblies.

#### Basic Registration

```csharp
using Blazing.Mediator;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container
builder.Services.AddControllers();

// Register Mediator with CQRS handlers
builder.Services.AddMediator(typeof(Program).Assembly);

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseAuthorization();
app.MapControllers();

app.Run();
```

#### With Middleware Pipeline

```csharp
using Blazing.Mediator;

// Register Mediator with optional middleware pipeline
builder.Services.AddMediator(config =>
{
    // Add logging middleware for all requests
    config.AddMiddleware<LoggingMiddleware<,>>();

    // Add conditional middleware for specific request types
    config.AddMiddleware<ValidationMiddleware<,>>();
}, typeof(Program).Assembly);
```

#### With Type-Constrained Middleware _**(NEW!)**_

```csharp
using Blazing.Mediator;

// Register Mediator with type-constrained middleware
builder.Services.AddMediator(config =>
{
    // Add middleware that only processes ICommand requests
    config.AddMiddleware<ValidationMiddleware<>>(); // where TRequest : ICommand

    // Add middleware that only processes IQuery<TResponse> requests  
    config.AddMiddleware<CachingMiddleware<,>>(); // where TRequest : IQuery<TResponse>

    // Add general middleware for all requests
    config.AddMiddleware<LoggingMiddleware<,>>();
}, typeof(Program).Assembly);
```

### Usage

#### Create a Query (CQRS Read Side)

```csharp
// Query - Request with response (Read operation)
public class GetUserByIdQuery : IRequest<UserDto>
{
    public int UserId { get; set; }
}

// Query Handler - Handles read operations
public class GetUserByIdHandler : IRequestHandler<GetUserByIdQuery, UserDto>
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _repository;

    public GetUserByIdHandler(IUserRepository repository)
    {
        _repository = repository;
    }

    public async Task<UserDto> Handle(GetUserByIdQuery request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var user = await _repository.GetByIdAsync(request.UserId);
        return new UserDto { Id = user.Id, Name = user.Name, Email = user.Email };
    }
}
```

#### Create a Command (CQRS Write Side)

```csharp
// Command - Request without response (Write operation)
public class CreateUserCommand : IRequest
{
    public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public string Email { get; set; } = string.Empty;
}

// Command Handler - Handles write operations
public class CreateUserHandler : IRequestHandler<CreateUserCommand>
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _repository;

    public CreateUserHandler(IUserRepository repository)
    {
        _repository = repository;
    }

    public async Task Handle(CreateUserCommand request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var user = new User { Name = request.Name, Email = request.Email };
        await _repository.AddAsync(user);
        await _repository.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
}
```

#### Use in API Controllers

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class UsersController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IMediator _mediator;

    public UsersController(IMediator mediator) => _mediator = mediator;

    // Query endpoint (CQRS Read)
    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public async Task<ActionResult<UserDto>> GetUser(int id)
    {
        var query = new GetUserByIdQuery { UserId = id };
        var result = await _mediator.Send(query);
        return Ok(result);
    }

    // Command endpoint (CQRS Write)
    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> CreateUser([FromBody] CreateUserCommand command)
    {
        await _mediator.Send(command);
        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetUser), new { id = 0 }, null);
    }
}
```

### CQRS Implementation

Blazing.Mediator naturally implements the **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** pattern:

**Commands (Write Operations)**

-   Use `IRequest` for operations that change state
-   Don't return data (void operations)
-   Focus on business intent and state changes
-   Examples: `CreateUserCommand`, `UpdateProductCommand`, `DeleteOrderCommand`

**Queries (Read Operations)**

-   Use `IRequest<TResponse>` for operations that retrieve data
-   Return data without changing state
-   Can be optimised with caching and read models
-   Examples: `GetUserByIdQuery`, `GetProductsQuery`, `GetOrderHistoryQuery`

This separation enables:

-   **Performance Optimisation**: Different strategies for reads vs writes
-   **Scalability**: Independent scaling of read and write operations
-   **Security**: Different validation and authorisation rules
-   **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

### Middleware Pipeline

The optional middleware pipeline allows you to add cross-cutting concerns without modifying your core business logic:

```csharp
// Standard middleware - executes for all requests
public class LoggingMiddleware<TRequest, TResponse> : IRequestMiddleware<TRequest, TResponse>
    where TRequest : IRequest<TResponse>
{
    public async Task<TResponse> HandleAsync(TRequest request, RequestHandlerDelegate<TResponse> next, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Pre-processing
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing {typeof(TRequest).Name}");

        var response = await next();

        // Post-processing
        Console.WriteLine($"Completed {typeof(TRequest).Name}");
        return response;
    }
}

// Conditional middleware - executes only for specific requests
public class OrderLoggingMiddleware<TRequest, TResponse> : IConditionalMiddleware<TRequest, TResponse>
    where TRequest : IRequest<TResponse>
{
    public bool ShouldExecute(TRequest request) =>
        request.GetType().Name.Contains("Order", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);

    public async Task<TResponse> HandleAsync(TRequest request, RequestHandlerDelegate<TResponse> next, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"üõí Processing order: {typeof(TRequest).Name}");
        var response = await next();
        Console.WriteLine($"üõí Order completed");
        return response;
    }
}

// Type-constrained middleware - executes only for commands (NEW!)
public class ValidationMiddleware<TRequest> : IRequestMiddleware<TRequest>
    where TRequest : ICommand  // Only processes commands, not queries
{
    public async Task HandleAsync(TRequest request, RequestHandlerDelegate next, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"üìã Validating command: {typeof(TRequest).Name}");
        
        // Validation logic here
        await ValidateAsync(request, cancellationToken);
        
        await next();
    }
}
```
